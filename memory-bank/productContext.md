# Product Context

## Purpose & Problems Solved
This project addresses several key challenges:
1. **Vector Storage Integration**: Simplifies the process of storing notes as vector embeddings
2. **Semantic Understanding**: Enables future semantic search capabilities through vector representations
3. **MCP Tool Exposure**: Provides a standardized interface for note operations
4. **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Handles the complexity of vector storage and embedding generation

## User Experience Goals
