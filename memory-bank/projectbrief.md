# Project Brief: MCP Pinecone Notes

## Core Purpose
MCP Pinecone Notes is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides vector-based note storage capabilities. It transforms text notes into vector embeddings and stores them in Pinecone, enabling potential semantic search and similarity matching features.

## Core Requirements
1. Expose note storage functionality via MCP server interface
2. Generate vector embeddings for notes using Nomic
3. Store notes and their embeddings in Pinecone
4. Maintain reliability and data consistency
5. Support environment-based configuration

## Goals
- Enable efficient storage and future retrieval of vectorized notes
- Provide a clean MCP interface for note operations
- Ensure scalable vector storage using Pinecone's infrastructure
- Support future expansion of note management capabilities

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Note addition with vector embeddings
- MCP server implementation
- Pinecone integration
- Environment configuration management

### Future Scope
- Note retrieval and querying
- Metadata management
- Note categorization
- Batch operations
